## COM3504 Assignment - Twitter Search Application

### Application is build upon Twitter Search & Streaming API, to allow you to search for various tweets published on twitter.com in real-time. Application is more focused on football players and clubs, so it would provide extra information about players and clubs, but not, apparently, limited by that.

### List of functions to be added later:
- [x] Querying Twitter Search & Streaming APIs'
    - [ ] Players, e.g. using their names, Twitter screen names or a range of selected keywords or hashtags
    - [ ] Football teams using their names
    - [ ] Authors of tweets
- [ ] Output fetched tweets in user-friendly manner
    - [ ] Return a list of 300 tweets ( or less, if there are no 300 tweets)
    - [ ] For each tweet provide following:
      1. Author, text, time and date
      2. the link to the original message and
      3. a link to the authorâ€™s page
- [ ] Plot frequency graphs: how often searched player or club appears in tweets over specific time frame
- [ ] Store data in MySQL database
    - [ ] Database should be used as source of data
    - [ ] Database should be used as a cache to reduce number of queries sent to Twitter API
