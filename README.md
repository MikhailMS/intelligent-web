## COM3504 Assignment - Twitter Search Application

### Application is build upon Twitter Search & Streaming API, to allow you to search for various tweets published on twitter.com in real-time. Application is more focused on football players and clubs, so it would provide extra information about players and clubs, but not, apparently, limited by that.

### List of functions to be added later:
- [ ] Querying Twitter Search & Streaming APIs'
- [ ] Output fetched twits in user-friendly manner
- [ ] Plot frequency graphs: how often searched player or club appears in twits over specific time frame
- [ ] Store data in MySQL database
- [ ] Build a mobile application with Apache Cordova
- [ ] Integrate information retrieved from DBPedia (data about clubs and/or players)
